**Exercise 1: Simple Todo List (Beginner)**

**Overview:**

Create a simple todo list application that allows users to add, remove, and mark tasks as completed. This exercise will help you solidify your understanding of basic React concepts like components, state, and event handling.

**How it works:**

1. Create a main component to manage the state of the todo list.
2. Define a child component for each todo item, displaying the task description and a checkbox for completion.
3. Use state to store the list of todo items.
4. Implement event handlers to add, remove, and toggle the completion status of todo items.

**Insights:**

- This exercise reinforces the concept of components as reusable building blocks in React.
- It demonstrates how to manage state effectively to update the UI based on user interactions.
